## Project Name  
Predicting NFL Outcomes Using Machine Learning  

## Exploratory Data Analysis  

### Project Dataset  
The dataset used in this project was a dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset used is the `NFL Team Stats 2002 - Feb. 2023 (ESPN)` dataset on Kaggle from user CVIAXMIWNPTR. The link to this dataset is <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cviaxmiwnptr/nfl-team-stats-20022019-espn">Kaggle Dataset Link</a>.  

### Exploratory Data Analysis  
The Exploratory Data Analysis report is the PDF file named `DS_EDA_NVR.pdf`. This report provides a description, summary statistics, visualizations, and a summary of findings for the dataset. The Exploratory Data Analysis Python code is the Jupyter Notebook named `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`. The visualizations created in the `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook are stored in the EDA_Visualizations folder. Also the `EDA_Expanded_NFL_Dataset.csv` is a .csv file of the dataset after a few cleaning steps were undertaken in the EDA process.
